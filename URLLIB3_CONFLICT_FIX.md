# urllib3 Dependency Conflict - Fixed

## Problem
The requirements file had conflicting urllib3 version constraints:
- **Line 22**: `botocore==1.16.26` requires `urllib3<1.26 and >=1.20`
- **Line 186**: `requests==2.32.5` requires `urllib3<3 and >=1.21.1`
- **Line 225**: `urllib3>=1.20,<1.26` (explicit constraint)

Additionally, `requests 2.32.5` may pull in `urllib3[socks]` dependencies that require urllib3 2.x, which conflicts with botocore 1.16.26's requirement.

## Solution Applied

### Changes Made to `requirements_11_01_2026_latest.txt`:

1. **Updated botocore** (line 22):
   - From: `botocore==1.16.26`
   - To: `botocore>=1.28.0`
   - Reason: Newer versions support urllib3 >= 1.26

2. **Updated boto3** (line 21):
   - From: `boto3==1.13.4`
   - To: `boto3>=1.28.0`
   - Reason: Must match botocore version

3. **Updated urllib3 constraint** (line 225):
   - From: `urllib3>=1.20,<1.26`
   - To: `urllib3>=1.26.0,<2.0`
   - Reason: Compatible with both botocore >=1.28.0 and requests 2.32.5

## Result

Now all packages have compatible urllib3 requirements:
- ✅ `botocore>=1.28.0` supports `urllib3>=1.26`
- ✅ `requests==2.32.5` supports `urllib3>=1.21.1,<3`
- ✅ `urllib3>=1.26.0,<2.0` satisfies both constraints

## Next Steps

Try installing again:

```powershell
pip install -r DBSolar_19_09_2023\requirements_11_01_2026_latest.txt
```

If you encounter any other conflicts, they should be resolved automatically by pip's dependency resolver.
